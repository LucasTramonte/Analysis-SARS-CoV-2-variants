In 'exploratory_Sociodemographic_Obstetrical' and 'exploratory_Clinical features', the relationships between the variables of interest to the research were analyzed:

## Installation

The database for this project is public :https://opendatasus.saude.gov.br/dataset/srag-2021-a-2023.
(The analyses carried out do not include updates to the database since 2022.)

As such, the dataset has not been placed in the repository, but the data dictionary is contained in the 'Data' folder
